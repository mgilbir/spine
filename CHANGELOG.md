# Changelog

## Unreleased

User-visible changes from the audit remediation series (#59–#75).

### Fixed

- Property edits made through `Properties` after `Open` now persist on save
  in docx and xlsx; previously they were silently dropped (#66).
- opc: decompression limits are enforced per reader and are safe under
  concurrent part reads; `File.Open` streams are bounded by the same budget.
  Unknown core-property children survive round-trips, and foreign-namespace
  core properties are no longer rewritten into Dublin Core elements (#59, #66).
- common/xml: carriage returns in text content survive round-trips, inline
  xmlns declarations are scoped to their element, and Builder errors from
  every part marshal are surfaced instead of swallowed (#60, #67).
- dml: single-color effects accept all six color kinds, the full set of
  color transforms round-trips, and extension lists are preserved with
  their inline namespace declarations (#61, #68).
- docx: run-level content (`delText`, `pict`, `object`, comment references),
  OMML equations, and header/footer image relationships are preserved;
  unmodeled body, inline, and row markup is captured raw and written back
  verbatim; numbering, styles, and settings parts are written on both save
  lifecycles, so documents built with `Create` now include `styles.xml`
  (#62, #72).
- pptx: `Open` reports parse errors in referenced slide, layout, and master
  parts instead of silently dropping or fabricating content; unreferenced
  slide parts and unknown `graphicData` content are preserved; table, group,
  and media mutations patch parts surgically; `ReplaceText` splices are
  rune-safe (#64, #65).
- pptx: extension lists, `AlternateContent`, custom shows, slide flags, and
  animation timing details survive open/save cycles (#69, #70).
- pptx: group shapes added via `AddShape` are serialized (previously a
  silent no-op), text replacement works across `br`/`fld` paragraphs, and
  removing slides no longer leaves orphan notes or media parts (#64, #71).
- xlsx: overwriting a shared-formula master no longer corrupts follower
  cells; a stale `calcChain.xml` is dropped when sheet data changes;
  workbook mutators persist on files that lacked the target element;
  data-validation alerts, freeze panes, dimension refresh, date detection,
  and sheet-deletion cleanup fixed (#63, #73).
- common/omml: the old `OMath` model never worked in either direction —
  unmarshal left every element empty and re-marshal emitted garbage; it is
  replaced by a working, order-preserving typed model (#75).

### Changed

- Save fails loudly instead of writing corrupt output: saving a workbook
  with zero sheets is an error, and unbalanced marshals abort the save
  (#67, #73).
- Error returns added to APIs that previously failed silently:
  `Slide.AddShape` (pptx), `Sheet.SetName` and `Sheet.MergeCells` (xlsx,
  both now validate their inputs), and `Writer.AddRelationship` (opc)
  (#66, #71, #73).
- xlsx: `DataValidation.ShowDropDown`, whose semantics were inverted and
  had no effect, is replaced by `HideDropDown` (#73).
- pptx: `CreateWithOptions` honors `Options.SlideSize` (widescreen and
  paper sizes included); `Create` keeps its documented 4:3 default (#71).

### Added

- pptx: read-only `Placeholders()` and `Theme()` (color and font schemes)
  on slide masters and layouts (#71).
- xlsx: exported builtin number-format ids (#73).
- common/omml: a typed model of the full Office Math (OMML) element set —
  math zones and paragraphs, runs, fractions, radicals, scripts, n-ary
  operators, delimiters, equation arrays, matrices, functions, limits, and
  the accent/bar/box family — with ordered content sequences, in-position
  raw capture of WordprocessingML and unknown children, and Builder-based
  serialization; docx gains `Paragraph.MathZones`/`MathParas` for typed
  on-demand access to stored equations and `Paragraph.AddMath`/`AddMathPara`
  for writing typed math, while raw bytes remain the storage format so byte
  fidelity is unaffected (#75).
- testdata: a Common Crawl OOXML corpus pipeline — committed manifests
  pinning real-world candidates per format from crawl CC-MAIN-2026-25
  (`testdata/cc/sweep.sh`), a resumable stdlib-only fetcher
  (`tools/ccfetch`, `make fetch-cc`) that validates and classifies each
  WARC payload — plus a gated live mode that refetches candidates the
  crawler truncated at 1 MiB from their origin, screened through a
  DNS-over-HTTPS blocklist resolver — and a corpus test (`cctest`) running
  open/save/reopen/part-fidelity over every fetched file with a committed
  quarantine of known failures; the corpus itself stays local and
  gitignored (#76).

### Removed

- pptx dead option/export API with no consumers: `OpenOptions`,
  `SaveOptions`, `ExportFormat`/`ExportOptions`, and the unused create
  options (#71).
- `common/docprops`: unused, namespace-incorrect duplicate of the opc
  core-properties support (#74).
